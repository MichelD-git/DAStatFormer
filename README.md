# DAStatFormer  
**A Hybrid Multibranch Transformer with Statistical Features for DAS-Based Event Recognition**

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **DAStatFormer**, a hybrid Transformer-based framework for **event recognition from Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data**.

DAStatFormer combines:
- **Compact multidomain statistical features** (temporal, waveform, spectral),
- **Multibranch Gated Transformer Networks (GTN)**,
- **Step-wise and channel-wise self-attention with adaptive gating**,

to achieve **accurate, scalable, and interpretable classification** of DAS events while drastically reducing computational cost compared to raw-signal-based approaches.

This code accompanies a paper submitted to **ICPR 2026**.

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- Statistical feature-driven Transformer for DAS, avoiding raw high-dimensional signal processing  
- 24 ANOVA-selected interpretable features per channel, reducing data size by orders of magnitude  
- Multibranch attention architecture modeling both spatial (channel-wise) and attribute-wise dependencies  
- Efficient and scalable design suitable for real-time DAS monitoring  
- Validation on laboratory and real-world DAS datasets
